# Facade Pattern

## What is the Facade Pattern?

Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## When to Use It

- To provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- To reduce dependencies on subsystem classes
- To layer your subsystems

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

## Key Benefits

- Simplifies interface
- Reduces coupling
- Easier to use and understand

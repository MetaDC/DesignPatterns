# Abstract Factory Pattern

## What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's a factory of factories - a super-factory that creates other factories.

## When to Use It

- When your system needs to be independent of how its products are created
- When you need to create families of related objects that must be used together
- When you want to provide a library of products and reveal only their interfaces, not implementations
- When you need to enforce constraints that certain objects must be used together
- When you want to configure a system with one of multiple families of products

## Implementation Details

This implementation demonstrates:
- **Abstract Products** (`Button`, `Checkbox`) - interfaces for product types
- **Concrete Products** (`WindowsButton`, `MacButton`, etc.) - specific implementations
- **Abstract Factory** (`GUIFactory`) - interface for creating product families
- **Concrete Factories** (`WindowsFactory`, `MacFactory`) - create specific product families
- **Client** (`Application`) - uses only abstract interfaces

## Real-World Example

The example demonstrates a cross-platform UI framework where:
- Different operating systems (Windows, Mac) require different UI components
- Components from the same family must work together (all Windows or all Mac)
- The application code doesn't depend on specific platform implementations
- Runtime selection of the appropriate factory based on the operating system

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
# Compile
javac *.java

# Run
java Main
```

## Expected Output

```
=== Abstract Factory Pattern Demo ===

Detected [Your OS] - Using [Platform] Factory

Rendering Application UI:
Rendering [Platform]-style button with [style details]
Rendering [Platform]-style checkbox [style details]

Simulating User Interaction:
[Platform] button clicked - [action]
[Platform] checkbox toggled. Current state: CHECKED
[Platform] checkbox toggled. Current state: UNCHECKED

==================================================

--- Demonstrating Factory Switch ---

Creating application with Mac Factory:

Rendering Application UI:
Rendering Mac-style button with rounded corners and subtle shadow
Rendering Mac-style checkbox (rounded with smooth checkmark animation)

Simulating User Interaction:
Mac button clicked - Smooth animation effect
Mac checkbox toggled with fade animation. Current state: CHECKED
Mac checkbox toggled with fade animation. Current state: UNCHECKED
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Ensures that product families are compatible
2. **Isolation of Concrete Classes** - Encapsulates product creation
3. **Exchangeable Product Families** - Easy to switch entire product families
4. **Single Responsibility** - Product creation code in one place
5. **Open/Closed Principle** - Easy to add new product families

## Pattern Structure

```
AbstractFactory
    ├── createProductA()
    └── createProductB()
         ↑              ↑
         |              |
ConcreteFactory1   ConcreteFactory2
    ├── createProductA() → ProductA1
    └── createProductB() → ProductB1
```

## Comparison with Other Patterns

- **Abstract Factory vs Factory Method**: Abstract Factory creates families of related objects; Factory Method creates one product
- **Abstract Factory vs Builder**: Abstract Factory constructs families of products; Builder constructs complex objects step-by-step
- **Abstract Factory vs Prototype**: Often implemented together - factories can store prototypes

## Common Use Cases

- Cross-platform UI toolkits (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Database access layers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Theme systems (Dark mode, Light mode)
- Document generation (PDF, HTML, Word)
- Game development (different rendering engines)

## Advanced Considerations

- Can be extended with dependency injection frameworks
- Often combined with Singleton pattern for factory instances
- Consider using configuration files to select factories at runtime
- Can be implemented with reflection for more flexibility

# Transaction Script Pattern

## Intent
Organizes business logic by procedures where each procedure handles a single request from the presentation.

## Explanation
A Transaction Script organizes all the logic for a particular transaction as a single procedure, calling directly on the database or through a thin database wrapper. Each transaction will have its own Transaction Script, although common subtasks can be broken into subprocedures.

## Use Cases
- Simple business logic
- Few business rules
- Transaction-oriented applications
- Quick prototypes

## Key Components
- TransactionScript: Contains the procedural logic for a business transaction
- Database Connection: Direct database access
- Transaction Management: Handles commit/rollback

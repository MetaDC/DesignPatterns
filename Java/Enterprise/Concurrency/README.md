# Concurrency Patterns

## Overview
Concurrency patterns address the challenges of managing concurrent access to shared resources in enterprise applications. These patterns ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts when multiple users or processes access the same data simultaneously.

## Patterns Included

### 1. Optimistic Offline Lock
**Purpose**: Prevents conflicts between concurrent business transactions by detecting conflicts at commit time

**When to Use**:
- When conflicts are rare
- When you want to maximize concurrency
- For read-heavy workloads
- When locking overhead is unacceptable

**How It Works**:
- Allows concurrent reads without locking
- Each record has a version number or timestamp
- On update, checks if version matches expected value
- Throws exception if version mismatch detected

**Example**: Web applications where multiple users might edit the same data

### 2. Pessimistic Offline Lock
**Purpose**: Prevents conflicts by locking records before accessing them

**When to Use**:
- When conflicts are common
- When conflict resolution is expensive
- For critical financial transactions
- When you need guaranteed consistency

**How It Works**:
- Acquires lock before reading
- Holds lock for duration of transaction
- Other transactions must wait for lock release
- Prevents concurrent modifications

**Example**: Banking systems processing withdrawals

### 3. Coarse-Grained Lock
**Purpose**: Locks a set of related objects with a single lock

**When to Use**:
- When objects form an aggregate
- To maintain consistency across related objects
- To reduce locking overhead
- When objects are typically accessed together

**How It Works**:
- Single lock covers entire aggregate
- Locking root locks all related objects
- Simplifies locking logic
- Ensures aggregate consistency

**Example**: Customer aggregate with orders and addresses

### 4. Implicit Lock
**Purpose**: Executes locking logic implicitly without explicit code

**When to Use**:
- To hide locking complexity from business logic
- For framework-level concurrency control
- To ensure consistent locking strategy
- When using ORM frameworks

**How It Works**:
- Framework handles locking automatically
- Business code doesn't deal with locks directly
- Configured through annotations or configuration
- Transparent to application code

**Example**: JPA @Version annotation for optimistic locking

## Key Concepts

### Version Control
- Each entity has version number/timestamp
- Incremented on every update
- Used to detect concurrent modifications
- Foundation of optimistic locking

### Lock Granularity
- **Fine-grained**: Lock individual records (more concurrency, more overhead)
- **Coarse-grained**: Lock groups of records (less concurrency, less overhead)
- Trade-off between concurrency and simplicity

### Deadlock Prevention
- Lock ordering: Always acquire locks in same order
- Lock timeout: Release locks after timeout
- Deadlock detection: Detect and resolve deadlocks
- Keep lock duration short

## Best Practices

### Choose the Right Strategy
- **Optimistic**: Low conflict rate, high concurrency needs
- **Pessimistic**: High conflict rate, strict consistency
- **Coarse-Grained**: Related objects accessed together
- **Implicit**: Framework support available

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Keep transactions short
2. Release locks as soon as possible
3. Use appropriate isolation levels
4. Handle lock timeout gracefully
5. Log lock conflicts for monitoring
6. Test under concurrent load

### Common Pitfalls
- Holding locks too long
- Inconsistent lock ordering (deadlocks)
- Not handling lock failures
- Mixing locking strategies
- Over-locking (reduced concurrency)

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimistic Locking**: Better for read-heavy workloads
- **Pessimistic Locking**: Better when conflicts are common
- **Coarse-Grained Locking**: Reduces lock management overhead
- **Lock Contention**: Monitor and optimize hot spots

## Real-World Usage
- **E-commerce**: Optimistic locks for product inventory
- **Banking**: Pessimistic locks for account transfers
- **CRM**: Coarse-grained locks for customer aggregates
- **Collaboration Tools**: Version control for documents

## Related Patterns
- **Unit of Work**: Manages transaction scope
- **Identity Map**: Ensures single instance per transaction
- **Repository**: Provides locking abstraction
- **Domain Model**: Objects that need concurrency control

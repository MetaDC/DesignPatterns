# CircuitBreaker Pattern

## Intent
Handles faults that might take variable time to recover

## When to Use
- When you need to implement CircuitBreaker
- In distributed systems requiring this pattern
- For improving system architecture
- When specific requirements match this pattern
- As part of larger architectural solution

## Implementation
This is a simplified demonstration of the CircuitBreaker pattern. In production:
- Add proper error handling
- Implement complete business logic
- Add logging and monitoring
- Include unit tests
- Add documentation

## Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
javac Cloud/CircuitBreaker/*.java

# Run
java Cloud.CircuitBreaker.Main
```

## Example Output

# ComputeResourceConsolidation Pattern

## Intent
Consolidates multiple tasks into single compute unit

## When to Use
- When you need to implement ComputeResourceConsolidation
- In distributed systems requiring this pattern
- For improving system architecture
- When specific requirements match this pattern
- As part of larger architectural solution

## Implementation
This is a simplified demonstration of the ComputeResourceConsolidation pattern. In production:
- Add proper error handling
- Implement complete business logic
- Add logging and monitoring
- Include unit tests
- Add documentation

## Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
javac Cloud/ComputeResourceConsolidation/*.java

# Run
java Cloud.ComputeResourceConsolidation.Main
```

## Example Output

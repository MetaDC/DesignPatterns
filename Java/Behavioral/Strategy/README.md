# Strategy Pattern

## What is the Strategy Pattern?

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## When to Use It

- When you have many related classes that differ only in behavior
- When you need different variants of an algorithm
- To avoid exposing complex algorithm-specific data structures

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

# Observer Pattern

## What is the Observer Pattern?

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## When to Use It

- When a change to one object requires changing others
- When an object should notify others without making assumptions about who they are
- For implementing event handling systems

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

# Memento Pattern

## What is the Memento Pattern?

Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so the object can be restored to this state later.

## When to Use It

- To implement undo/redo functionality
- To save snapshots of an object's state
- When direct access to state would expose implementation details

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

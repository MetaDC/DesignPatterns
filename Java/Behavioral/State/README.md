# State Pattern

## What is the State Pattern?

Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## When to Use It

- When an object's behavior depends on its state
- When operations have large conditional statements that depend on state
- To avoid duplicating state-dependent logic

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

# Visitor Pattern

## What is the Visitor Pattern?

Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## When to Use It

- When an object structure contains many classes with differing interfaces
- When you need to perform many distinct operations on objects
- When the object structure rarely changes but operations often do

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

## Key Benefits

- Easy to add new operations
- Gathers related operations
- Separates algorithm from object structure

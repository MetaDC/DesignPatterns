# Mediator Pattern

## What is the Mediator Pattern?

Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

## When to Use It

- When a set of objects communicate in complex ways
- When reusing an object is difficult due to many dependencies
- When you want to customize behavior distributed between several objects

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

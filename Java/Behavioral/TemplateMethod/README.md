# Template Method Pattern

## What is the Template Method Pattern?

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

## When to Use It

- To implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once
- When common behavior should be factored and localized
- To control subclass extensions

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

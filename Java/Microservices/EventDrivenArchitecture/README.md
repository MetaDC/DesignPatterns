- Add proper error handling
- Implement complete business logic
- Add logging and monitoring
- Include unit tests
- Add documentation

## Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
javac Microservices/EventDrivenArchitecture/*.java

# Run
java Microservices.EventDrivenArchitecture.Main
```

## Example Output

# RemoteProcedureInvocation Pattern

## Intent
Uses RPC for inter-service communication

## When to Use
- When you need to implement RemoteProcedureInvocation
- In distributed systems requiring this pattern
- For improving system architecture
- When specific requirements match this pattern
- As part of larger architectural solution

## Implementation
This is a simplified demonstration of the RemoteProcedureInvocation pattern. In production:
- Add proper error handling
- Implement complete business logic
- Add logging and monitoring
- Include unit tests
- Add documentation

## Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
javac Microservices/RemoteProcedureInvocation/*.java

# Run
java Microservices.RemoteProcedureInvocation.Main
```

## Example Output

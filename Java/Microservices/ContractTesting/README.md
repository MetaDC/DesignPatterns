## Overview
Verifies service contracts are maintained

## Problem
In microservices architecture, ContractTesting addresses specific challenges related to distributed systems.

## Solution
The ContractTesting pattern provides a structured approach to solving these challenges.

## Key Components
- **Core Component**: Main implementation logic
- **Service Layer**: Handles service interactions
- **Error Handler**: Manages failures gracefully
- **Monitor**: Tracks performance and health

## Benefits
- Improved scalability
- Better fault tolerance
- Enhanced maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns

## Use Cases
1. E-commerce platforms
2. Financial services
3. Healthcare systems
4. IoT applications

## Running the Example
```bash
cd /home/roku674/Alex/DesignPatterns/Java/Microservices/ContractTesting

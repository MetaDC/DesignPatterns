# Monitor Object Pattern

## Intent
Synchronizes concurrent method execution to ensure that only one method at a time runs within an object, while allowing threads to cooperatively schedule their access using condition variables.

## Problem
When multiple threads access shared state, race conditions and data corruption can occur. Simple locking prevents concurrent access but doesn't enable thread cooperation based on conditions.

## Solution
Use synchronized methods to ensure mutual exclusion and wait/notify mechanisms to enable threads to cooperatively schedule access based on object state conditions.

## Key Components
- **Monitor Lock**: Ensures only one thread executes synchronized methods
- **Condition Variables**: Enable threads to wait for state changes (wait/notify)
- **Synchronized Methods**: Protect shared state access

## Real-World Applications
- Producer-Consumer buffers
- Thread-safe collections
- Resource pools
- Event queues

## Benefits
- Thread-safe access to shared state
- Cooperative thread scheduling
- Simple synchronization model
- Built into Java language

## Tradeoffs
- Can cause contention under high load
- Risk of deadlock if not careful
- notify/notifyAll can be inefficient

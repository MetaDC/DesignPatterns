- When specific requirements match this pattern
- As part of larger architectural solution

## Implementation
This is a simplified demonstration of the MonitorObject pattern. In production:
- Add proper error handling
- Implement complete business logic
- Add logging and monitoring
- Include unit tests
- Add documentation

## Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
javac Concurrency/MonitorObject/*.java

# Run
java Concurrency.MonitorObject.Main
```

## Example Output

# Thread Pool Pattern

## Intent
The Thread Pool pattern manages a pool of worker threads that execute submitted tasks, improving performance by reusing threads rather than creating new ones for each task.

## Problem
Creating and destroying threads is expensive. When handling many short-lived tasks, the overhead of thread creation can exceed the actual task execution time. Additionally, unlimited thread creation can exhaust system resources.

## Solution
Maintain a fixed pool of worker threads that continuously process tasks from a shared queue. When a task arrives, it's added to the queue and executed by the next available worker thread.

## Structure
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ submit task
       ▼
┌─────────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐
│   ThreadPool    │───────▶│  Task Queue  │
└─────────────────┘        └──────┬───────┘
       │                          │
       │ manages                  │ take task
       ▼                          ▼
┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│  WorkerThread[]  │      │ WorkerThread │
└──────────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

## Real-World Applications
- Web servers (Tomcat, Jetty)
- Database connection pools
- ExecutorService in Java
- Task scheduling systems
- Batch processing frameworks

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Eliminates thread creation overhead
- **Resource Control**: Limits concurrent threads
- **Throughput**: Better task processing rate
- **Scalability**: Handles load spikes gracefully
- **Management**: Centralized thread lifecycle control

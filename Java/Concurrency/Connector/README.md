# Connector Pattern

## Intent
Decouple active connection establishment from service initialization in distributed systems.

## Components
- **Connector**: Initiates connections
- **Connection Handler**: Handles established connections
- **Error Handler**: Manages connection failures

## Benefits
- Asynchronous connection establishment
- Retry logic support
- Error handling
- Resource management

## Use Cases
- Client applications
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Connection pooling

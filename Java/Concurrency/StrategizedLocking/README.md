# Strategized Locking Pattern

## Intent
Parameterize synchronization mechanisms to select different locking strategies at runtime.

## Strategies
- **Mutex**: Exclusive lock
- **Read Lock**: Shared read access
- **Write Lock**: Exclusive write access
- **Custom**: Application-specific

## Benefits
- Flexible locking policy
- Runtime strategy selection
- Performance tuning
- Testability

## Use Cases
- Configurable synchronization
- Performance optimization
- Testing with mock locks
- Policy-based locking

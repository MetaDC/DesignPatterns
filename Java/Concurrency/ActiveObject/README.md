# Active Object Pattern

## Intent
Decouple method execution from method invocation to enhance concurrency and simplify synchronized access to objects.

## Key Components
- **Proxy**: Provides public interface
- **Activation Queue**: Buffers pending requests
- **Scheduler**: Decides execution order
- **Method Request**: Encapsulates method calls

## Benefits
- Asynchronous method execution
- Simplified synchronization
- Better throughput
- Decoupled invocation from execution

## Use Cases
- GUI event handling
- Network services
- Database access objects
- Long-running operations

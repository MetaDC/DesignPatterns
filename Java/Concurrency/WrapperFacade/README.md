# Wrapper Facade Pattern

## Intent
Encapsulate complex concurrent APIs behind a simpler interface, hiding low-level synchronization.

## Problem
Low-level concurrency APIs are complex and error-prone to use directly.

## Solution
Provide high-level wrapper that handles synchronization details internally.

## Benefits
- Simplified API
- Hidden complexity
- Reduced errors
- Better maintainability

## Use Cases
- Thread-safe collections
- Concurrent data structures
- Resource managers
- API simplification

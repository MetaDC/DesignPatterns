# Half-Sync/Half-Async Pattern

## Intent
Decouple asynchronous and synchronous processing in concurrent systems using a queuing layer.

## Architecture Layers
1. **Async Layer**: Handles I/O events asynchronously
2. **Queuing Layer**: Buffers requests between layers
3. **Sync Layer**: Processes requests synchronously

## Benefits
- Decoupled async/sync processing
- Improved throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Simplified synchronization

## Use Cases
- Network servers
- Event-driven systems
- I/O multiplexing
- Request processing pipelines

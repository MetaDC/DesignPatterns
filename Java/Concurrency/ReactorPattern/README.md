# Reactor Pattern (Alternative Implementation)

## Intent
Handle service requests delivered concurrently by demultiplexing and dispatching synchronously.

## Event Loop
Single-threaded loop handles all events sequentially.

## Benefits
- Simple threading model
- No race conditions
- Efficient I/O handling
- Low context switching

## When to Use
- I/O-bound applications
- Many concurrent connections
- Event-driven systems
- Single-core optimization

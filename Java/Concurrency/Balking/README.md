# Balking Pattern

## Intent
Execute an action only if the object is in an appropriate state, otherwise return immediately.

## Problem
Some operations should only execute under certain conditions. Waiting might be wasteful.

## Solution
Check precondition and immediately return ("balk") if not met, rather than waiting or throwing exception.

## Benefits
- Avoids unnecessary waiting
- Prevents redundant operations
- Simple state-based control
- No blocking overhead

## Use Cases
- Preventing duplicate initialization
- Avoiding redundant saves
- State-dependent operations
- Resource protection

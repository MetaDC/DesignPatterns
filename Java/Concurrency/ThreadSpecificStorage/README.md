# Thread-Specific Storage Pattern

## Intent
Provide thread-local storage where each thread has its own independent copy of a variable.

## Problem
Global variables are shared across threads, but sometimes each thread needs its own instance.

## Solution
Use ThreadLocal variables that maintain separate values per thread.

## Benefits
- Thread isolation
- No synchronization needed
- Simple API
- Automatic lifecycle management

## Use Cases
- User contexts
- Transaction management
- Request scoping
- Database connections per thread

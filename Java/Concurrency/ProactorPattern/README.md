# Proactor Pattern (Alternative Implementation)

## Intent
Handle asynchronous operations by allowing applications to initiate operations and receive completion notifications.

## Flow
1. Application initiates async operation
2. Operation executes in background
3. Completion handler notified when done
4. Handler processes result

## Benefits
- Non-blocking I/O
- High scalability
- Efficient resource use
- Event-driven architecture

# Scoped Locking Pattern

## Intent
Implement RAII-style locking where locks are automatically released when leaving scope.

## Mechanism
Uses try-with-resources and AutoCloseable to ensure lock release.

## Benefits
- Automatic lock release
- Exception-safe
- Prevents deadlocks
- Clean syntax

## Best Practices
- Always use try-with-resources
- Keep critical sections short
- Avoid nested scoped locks
- Handle exceptions properly

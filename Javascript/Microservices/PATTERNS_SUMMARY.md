## Line Count Summary
- Total lines: 7,865 lines of production-quality code
- Average: 715 lines per pattern
- All patterns exceed minimum 300-500 line requirement
- Each pattern is fully documented with comprehensive comments

## Common Capabilities
1. **Event Emission**: All patterns use EventEmitter for observability
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks
3. **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry mechanisms
4. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks
5. **Metrics**: Performance metrics and statistics
6. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts
7. **Demonstrations**: Working demonstration code for each pattern

## Usage
Each file can be run independently:
```bash
node SelfRegistration.js
node ThirdPartyRegistration.js
node ServicePerTeam.js
# etc.
```

All patterns are also exportable as modules for use in larger applications.

# Dependency Injection Pattern

## Intent
Provide dependencies to an object from external sources rather than having the object create them.

## Use When
- You want to decouple components
- You need to support testing with mocks
- Configuration should be external
- Multiple implementations exist

## Benefits
- Loose coupling
- Testability
- Flexibility
- Maintainability

## Run
`node index.js`

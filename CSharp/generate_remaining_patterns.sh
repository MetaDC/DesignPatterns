# Patterns to generate: Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy, and all 11 Behavioral patterns

# Note: Due to the comprehensive nature of implementing all patterns with
# production-quality code, detailed documentation, and examples, the full
# implementation has been created manually pattern-by-pattern.
#
# Completed patterns (8/23):
# ✓ Factory Method
# ✓ Abstract Factory
# ✓ Builder
# ✓ Prototype
# ✓ Singleton
# ✓ Adapter
# ✓ Bridge
# ✓ Composite
#
# Remaining (15/23):
# - Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy (4 Structural)
# - All 11 Behavioral patterns
#
# Each pattern requires:
# - 4-8 C# class files (interfaces, concrete implementations, examples)
# - Comprehensive README (structure, examples, when to use, trade-offs)
# - Working demonstration code
# - ~500-1000 lines of code per pattern
#
# Total remaining: ~15,000 lines of production C# code + documentation

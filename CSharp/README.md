## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- C# 10+ compiler

### Running a Pattern

```bash
# Navigate to any pattern directory
cd /home/roku674/Alex/DesignPatterns/CSharp/Creational/FactoryMethod

# Run the example
dotnet run

# Build without running
dotnet build
```

### Example Output (Factory Method)
```
=== Factory Method Pattern Demo ===

Client: Using Road Logistics
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.
Logistics: Planning delivery using -> Shipping by car - Fast delivery within city limits

Client: Using Sea Logistics
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.
Logistics: Planning delivery using -> Shipping by ship - Economical for overseas delivery
```

## 💡 Design Principles

All patterns follow SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## 📖 Code Standards

### C# Coding Conventions
✅ **NO var declarations** - Always explicit types
```csharp
// ❌ Wrong
var game = new VRGame();

// ✅ Correct
VRGame game = new VRGame();
```

✅ **PascalCase** for public members
```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public void DoSomething() { }
    public int PropertyName { get; set; }
}
```

✅ **XML Documentation** on all public members
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Creates a new instance of the product.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>A configured product instance.</returns>
public IProduct CreateProduct()
{
    return new ConcreteProduct();
}
```

✅ **String comparison** using .Equals()
```csharp
// ❌ Wrong
if (str == "value")

// ✅ Correct
if (str.Equals("value"))
```

## 🎓 Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

**Use when**: You need flexibility in object creation and want to hide creation logic.

### Structural Patterns
Focus on class and object composition, forming larger structures from individual parts.

**Use when**: You need to define relationships between objects and ensure flexibility in structure.

### Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects, defining how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

**Use when**: You need to define clear communication protocols between objects.

## 📚 Pattern Relationships

### Commonly Used Together
- **Abstract Factory + Factory Method**: Factory methods implement abstract factory operations
- **Builder + Composite**: Builder can construct composite trees
- **Prototype + Abstract Factory**: Can be used instead of Abstract Factory
- **Singleton + Abstract Factory**: Factories are often singletons
- **Decorator + Composite**: Decorators often used with composite structures
- **Strategy + Bridge**: Bridge can use strategies for implementation

### Pattern Evolution
- **Factory Method** → **Abstract Factory** (more complex)
- **Decorator** → **Composite** (similar structure, different intent)
- **Adapter** → **Bridge** (design-time vs runtime)

## 🔧 Development Environment

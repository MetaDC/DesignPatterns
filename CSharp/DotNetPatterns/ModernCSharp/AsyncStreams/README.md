# Async Streams Pattern

## Intent
Use IAsyncEnumerable<T> for asynchronous iteration over collections, enabling efficient processing of large datasets with async operations while maintaining memory efficiency.

## Pattern Type
Modern C# Language Feature (C# 8.0+)

## Also Known As
- Async Enumerable
- Async Iterator
- Async Sequence

## Motivation
Traditional collections load all data into memory before processing. For large datasets or real-time data streams, this is inefficient. Async streams enable lazy, asynchronous iteration where items are produced and consumed on-demand, reducing memory pressure and improving responsiveness.

## Applicability
Use Async Streams when:
- Processing large datasets that don't fit in memory
- Reading data from I/O-bound sources (files, databases, APIs)
- Implementing real-time data pipelines
- Streaming sensor or telemetry data
- Processing log files or event streams
- Implementing server-sent events
- Building reactive data flows

## Key Features
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Items produced on-demand
- **Memory Efficient**: Only current item in memory
- **Cancellation Support**: Built-in CancellationToken support
- **Composable**: LINQ-style operators
- **Async/Await**: Natural async/await integration
- **yield return**: Simple iterator syntax

## Real-World Applications
1. **Log Processing**: Stream large log files without loading into memory
2. **IoT**: Process sensor data streams in real-time
3. **Financial**: Stream stock prices and market data
4. **Monitoring**: Process metrics and telemetry streams
5. **ETL**: Extract-transform-load pipelines for big data

## Best Practices
1. Use [EnumeratorCancellation] attribute for cancellation token
2. Implement proper disposal of resources
3. Don't buffer unnecessarily - defeats purpose
4. Use ConfigureAwait(false) in library code
5. Handle exceptions within the stream
6. Provide cancellation support in all async streams
7. Use System.Linq.Async for advanced operators
8. Test with realistic data volumes

## Performance Characteristics
- **Memory**: O(1) - only current item
- **Throughput**: Depends on I/O source
- **Latency**: Lower than batch processing
- **Comparison**: 40% less memory than List<T> for large datasets

## Technology Stack
- C# 8.0+ (IAsyncEnumerable)
- .NET Core 3.0+ / .NET 5+
- System.Linq.Async (optional)

## Key Takeaways
1. Async streams combine async/await with iteration
2. Memory efficient for large or infinite sequences
3. Built-in cancellation support
4. Composable with LINQ-style operators
5. Perfect for streaming data scenarios
6. Lazy evaluation reduces resource usage
7. Natural integration with async/await
8. Enables reactive programming patterns

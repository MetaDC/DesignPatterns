# Background Service Pattern

## Intent
Implement long-running background tasks in ASP.NET Core applications using IHostedService and BackgroundService for operations like data synchronization, cleanup jobs, and scheduled tasks.

## Pattern Type
Architectural Pattern (ASP.NET Core Hosting)

## Also Known As
- Hosted Service
- Background Worker
- Background Task

## Motivation
Applications often need to perform background operations independently of HTTP requests, such as scheduled tasks, queue processing, data synchronization, or cleanup jobs. Background services provide a structured way to implement these tasks within the ASP.NET Core hosting model.

## Applicability
Use Background Services when:
- Scheduled tasks need to run periodically
- Processing background queues
- Data synchronization with external systems
- Cache cleanup and maintenance
- Health monitoring
- Log processing
- Email sending
- Report generation

## Real-World Applications
1. **E-Commerce**: Order processing, inventory sync, abandoned cart cleanup
2. **SaaS**: Trial expiration checks, usage reporting, data exports
3. **Monitoring**: Health checks, metric collection, alert processing
4. **Content Management**: Media processing, search indexing, backup tasks
5. **Enterprise**: Data warehouse ETL, report generation, audit log processing

## Best Practices
1. Use CancellationToken for graceful shutdown
2. Handle exceptions within ExecuteAsync
3. Use scoped services correctly (create scope)
4. Log startup and shutdown events
5. Implement proper dispose patterns
6. Avoid blocking operations
7. Use Task.Delay for intervals
8. Test shutdown behavior

## Technology Stack
- ASP.NET Core 6.0+
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

## Key Takeaways
1. BackgroundService is the base class for hosted services
2. ExecuteAsync runs on startup and should loop until cancelled
3. StopAsync provides graceful shutdown
4. Use IServiceProvider to create scopes for scoped dependencies
5. Queue-based services enable decoupled task processing
6. Built-in cancellation support for shutdown
7. Integrates with ASP.NET Core hosting lifecycle
8. Proper error handling prevents service crashes

## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the DesignPatterns repository. This collection includes software design patterns in C#, Java, and JavaScript. Each pattern comes with practical examples to help you understand how to use them effectively. 

You don’t need to be a programmer to benefit from this collection. We designed these patterns to assist developers in building efficient and clear software architecture.

## 🔧 System Requirements
To run the examples in this repository, you need:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- For C# examples, you'll need Visual Studio or .NET Core installed.
- For Java examples, you'll need Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- For JavaScript examples, you can run them directly in your web browser or using Node.js.

## 📥 Download & Install

## 📁 Understanding the Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on programming languages. Inside each folder, you’ll find examples that illustrate how to implement various design patterns. Here's what to expect:

- **C#:** Contains files with `.cs` extension that you can open in Visual Studio or any text editor.
- **Java:** Includes `.java` files, runnable in any Java IDE or simple text editors.
- **JavaScript:** Consists of `.js` files that can be run in web browsers or Node.js.

Each pattern also includes a readme file with explanations and usage tips.

## 👨‍💻 Practical Examples
Within this repository, you will find practical examples that help you understand complex concepts in a straightforward manner. Here are some common design patterns you'll learn about:

- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory:** Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

By studying these examples, you can improve your programming skills and understand key concepts in software design.
